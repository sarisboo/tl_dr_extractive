# ðŸ¤– In-depth Analysis

## Supervised methods

The classifiers selected for this analysis were Multinomial Naive Bayes and a Random forest Classifier. We used both to compare their performance in a supervised setting.

We cross validated our training dataset to tune the different hyperparameters in hope of increasing recall without sacrificing too much precision.

We tried to adjust for class imbalance by setting the scoring parameter of GridsearchCV to `f1` and the `class_weight` parameter of the Random Forest Classifier to `balanced`. There are other ways we could try to address the class imbalance like under or oversampling via SMOTE using the imblearn library.

For scoring, we will look at precision and recall as well as the f1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) for all the models we used and combinations of features used. We use this scoring because the finality is that the model catches as many summary sentences as possible even if it comes with a little noise.

### BOW Model

We used sklearn's CountVectorizer to  create a simple bag of words model (using a combination of unigrams and bigrams). The reason is that the multinomial naive bayes classifier is best suitable for classification with discrete features and thus requires integer feature counts.

### LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)

It is a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modelled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities.

The topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document.

In the following results, we compare the performance of different models and combinations of features. The key here is to get a reliable summary and thus to achieve a good recall-precision balance for the category labeled as 1 (summary class) in the classification report. For this, we usually look at:

**Precision**: What proportion of summary sentences were actual ones.

</p>

**Recall**: What proportion of summary sentences were indeed summary sentences.

<p align=center>
  <img src="images/total-recall.png" />
</p>

**F1 score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall with values ranging from 0 to 1. It is a pretty good measure of a test&#39;s accuracy for binary classifications.

</p>

After looking at those metrics, we plotted the distribution of recalls at the article level for the testing set, which means we calculated the recall for each article and looked at how they are distributed for a specific model. Our goal is to get as many recalls close or equal to 1 as possible.

We then compare the actual and predicted summaries on completely new articles that we feed to our model and view examples of actual Vs predicted. The closer in meaning the predicted summary gets to the actual one the more limited the information loss.

The final step is to see how much &#39;compression&#39; we achieved for each one of these examples, we mean by compression the percentage of original length we end up reading after generating the summary. We also calculate the recall for each article for every model and see what the ratio recall/compression looks like.

#### Compression vs. recall

| **Text examples** | **Real Compression** | **Prediction Compression** | **Recall** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Text 1** | `0.08` | `0.11` | `0.71` |
| **Text 2** | `0.12` | `0.09` | `0.51` |
| **Text 3** | `0.14` | `0.12` | `0.47` |

When we look at our key metrics for evaluating performance, we can see that the best model in our case is the Multinomial Naive Bayes + LDA  which is only slightly better than the simple Multinomial Naive Bayes model.

More generally both Multinomial Naive Bayes (with and without LDA) perform better than the  Random Forest Classifier. This doesn't necessarily mean that adding LDA to a Multinomial Naive Bayes model will always result in a better performance in comparison to the same model but without adding the LDA feature as other unidentified factors may be involved.

When we look at both Random Forest Classifier examples of predicted summaries, they are generally much longer than the real summaries which corresponds to the low precision of these models for the summary class.

This defeats the purpose of summarization which tries to minimize reading time (summary text length) and maximize information gain (highest possible real summary sentences concentration) for selection purposes.

Finally, when we look at the behavior of the predicted compression compared to the real compression ratios, we can see a tendency for the Random Forest classifiers to "compress" less meaning they retain more summary sentences than the actual summary which logically increases the odds of the recall being high.

On the other hand, for the Multinomial Naive Bayes models the compression is more or less similar to the real compression but in these cases the recall values tend to fluctuate more. One hypothesis to help stabilize the recalls would be for example adding more training data consisting of longer texts to allow the model to select more actual summary sentences.

## Unsupervised Method

As an unsupervised method we used LDA with K-Means to see how efficiently summary and non summary sentences can be identified as  different clusters.

### LDA+KMEANS

We can see here a very high recall but a significant drop in precision, it is basically always right because it considers the vast majority of sentences as belonging to one class which means it would select most of the summary sentences.
