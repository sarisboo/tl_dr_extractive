# Project Aims

This project is about figuring out what  makes a good summary sentence. This will allow us to later be able to extract the best candidates from incoming text.

Given that we have a labeled dataset, we can apply [supervised techniques](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C08-1124/) to our analysis using a [Naive Bayes](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Naive_Bayes_classifier) classifier.

We will leverage the labeled dataset to look at the text from various angles to determine what makes a sentence worth picking for generating an extractive summary. These factors can include sentence lengths, similarities, counts and frequencies.
