      "Stop what you re doing. Take a break. Focus on your senses. Take some deep breaths. Inhale slowly through your nose. Try to relax your muscles. Get some exercise. Recognize what stress looks like for you. Identify the cause of your stress. Acknowledge your role. Determine if you re stressing about something that is in the past. Determine whether you re stressed about the future. Practice relaxation. Inhale deeply through your nose. Think about something else. Choose your response. Make a plan. Be realistic. Take one step at a time. Stop procrastinating. Practice mindfulness. Try a self compassion break. Use the RAIN reminder. Repeat positive statements. Release stress productively. Cry if you want to. Listen to some soothing music. Take a hot shower or bath \n",

      "Stop what you re doing. Take a break. I can do this. Focus on your senses. My heart is beating very fast. My palms feel sweaty. I feel nauseated. Take some deep breaths. Aim to breathe from your diaphragm instead. Inhale slowly through your nose. Hold the breath for seconds. Then, slowly exhale through your nose or mouth. Try to relax your muscles. There are several free guided PMR routines online. MIT has a free minute audio guide to doing PMR. Loosen tight clothing if possible. Breathe evenly as you do your PMR groups. Squeeze your eyes shut tightly for seconds, then release the tension. Give yourself seconds to notice how these areas feel. Move to the next group. Purse your lips tightly for seconds, then release. Give yourself a second relaxation break between groups. Get some exercise. Exercise may also have a preventive effect. Try exercises such as yoga and tai chi. Recognize what stress looks like for you. Identify the cause of your stress. Common sources of stress include Family. School or work. You may worry about feeling good enough. Acknowledge your role. Take a step back and consider how you think about stress. Try thinking about your past in a more productive way. Determine whether you re stressed about the future. We all worry about our futures at some point. Remember the future isn t set. I could even fail the semester. Then, consider whether you could handle it. Chances are almost always yes. Finally, consider the real likelihood that this will occur. Practice relaxation. Inhale deeply through your nose. Think about something else. Get away from the cause of the stress. Acknowledge that anxiety is not always bad. Choose your response. You can choose to refocus your thinking. Consider some questions when deciding your approach. Can you avoid it. Can you alter it. Can you accept it. Some things you simply cannot change. You cannot change or control others feelings, actions, or reactions. Make a plan. Additionally, many stressful situations are avoidable. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Be realistic. Learn from your experience, but let it go. Take one step at a time. Just focus on one small goal at a time. Stop procrastinating. Often, perfectionism is a culprit. Remind yourself that you cannot control outcomes, only actions. Acknowledge that perfection is an unrealistic standard. Watch out for should statements. Everyone makes mistakes in life. Practice mindfulness. Stress can be a great motivator. Try it for minutes a day. Begin with a handful of raisins. Take one between your fingers and hold it. Make a mental note of what the raisin feels like. Examine the raisin visually. Notice its colors, its shape, its textures. Smell the raisin. Enjoy any aroma that you smell. Try to describe it to yourself. Place the raisin on your tongue. Notice how it feels there. Can you feel the weight. Taste the raisin by taking a small bite. Swallow the raisin. What muscles are you using. What does it feel like. Try a self compassion break. Think of the stressful situation. Use the RAIN reminder. It stands for Recognize what is going on. Investigate with kindness. She makes me so mad. I made a mistake that I can acknowledge. We can work together to solve this issue. Natural awareness arises from not over personalizing the experience. Avoid having your TV, computer, or cellphone on. Close your eyes and breathe evenly and deeply. Begin by focusing just on your breath. Notice your sensations without judgment. MITand the UCLA Mindful Awareness Research Centerboth have online MP meditations. Repeat positive statements. I can do my best. That is enough. I am bigger than my problems. My mistakes do not define me. I am human. We all make errors. Release stress productively. Cry if you want to. Listen to some soothing music. Take a hot shower or bath\n",

      "Know that everyone has their own unique experience with grief. Allow yourself to feel your own unique emotions and acknowledge your unique experience. Acknowledge that there are many kinds of loss. Do not be afraid to mourn. Acknowledge your emotions as a natural response. There are many losses you may experience in life. No loss is greater or less than any other. Recognize that stages of mourning do not really exist. Avoid expecting yourself to progress through particular stages. Elisabeth Kübler Ross famously defined five stages of emotional reaction to death and dying in. These stages are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Distinguish between grief and mourning. Grief includes your emotions and thoughts after you experience a loss. You cannot control your experience of grief. Grief may feel like a rollercoaster. The full mourning process may take years, even a lifetime. Learn about the necessary tasks of mourning. These tasks are Accepting the reality of loss. This can take time. Processing grief. Grief in response to a loss is a natural emotional reaction. Adjusting to the world after loss. Recognize physical symptoms of grief. Recognize emotional symptoms of grief. Grief is emotionally complex and deeply personal. These are all natural reactions to grief. Recognize signs of grief in children. These signs include Emotional shock. S he may refuse to talk about the loss. Regressive or immature behaviors. Explosive behavior and misbehaving. Repeating questions. Defensive behavior.

      "Think about the time commitment of ferret proofing your home. Ferrets will chew such objects. Ferrets are social animals. Ferrets do sleep a lot. Remember that ferrets require training. Also, ferrets must be taught proper behavior. Ferrets are intelligent and highly trainable. However, like any animal, training takes time and persistence. Keep cleaning time in mind. Remember a ferret s lifespan. Ferrets live between to years. Think about the stability of your living situation. Consider other factors. Avoid a ferret if you have young children. Ferrets do not do well with young children. Ferrets will bite if handled roughly. Think about how busy your home is. First, ferrets are underfoot a lot. Second, ferrets have tendency to escape. Consider your other pets. Cats and dogs are often aggressive with ferrets. Decide whether you can tolerate the smell. Ferrets come with a strong odor. The scent glands a ferret uses to mark territory secrete oil, leaving a musty scent in your home. Also, think about legally housing a ferret. Check with your landlord before adopting a ferret. Learn about adoption and purchase fees. Ferrets are not cheap. Not all vets are familiar with treating ferrets. Consider the cost of sterilization. Weigh in other general costs of care\n",

      "Stop what you re doing. Take a break. Focus on your senses. Take some deep breaths. Inhale slowly through your nose. Try to relax your muscles. Get some exercise. Recognize what stress looks like for you. Identify the cause of your stress. Acknowledge your role. Determine if you re stressing about something that is in the past. Determine whether you re stressed about the future. Practice relaxation. Inhale deeply through your nose. Think about something else. Choose your response. Make a plan. Be realistic. Take one step at a time. Stop procrastinating. Practice mindfulness. Try a self compassion break. Use the RAIN reminder. Repeat positive statements. Release stress productively. Cry if you want to.

      "Stop what you re doing. Take a break. I can do this. Focus on your senses. My heart is beating very fast. My palms feel sweaty. I feel nauseated. Take some deep breaths. Aim to breathe from your diaphragm instead. Inhale slowly through your nose. Hold the breath for seconds. Then, slowly exhale through your nose or mouth. Aim to exhale for a count if you can. Try to relax your muscles. PMR focuses on consciously tensing and then releasing muscles by groups. There are several free guided PMR routines online. Berkeley has a script you can follow along with. MIT has a free minute audio guide to doing PMR. Find a quiet, comfortable place if you can. Loosen tight clothing if possible. Breathe evenly as you do your PMR groups. Give yourself seconds to notice how these areas feel. Move to the next group. Purse your lips tightly for seconds, then release. Give yourself a second relaxation break between groups. Get some exercise. Exercise may also have a preventive effect. Try exercises such as yoga and tai chi. Recognize what stress looks like for you. Identify the cause of your stress. Common sources of stress include Family. School or work. These sources can be intense. You may worry about feeling good enough. Acknowledge your role. Take a step back and consider how you think about stress. For example, perhaps you think, My family are all worriers. Try thinking about your past in a more productive way. Determine whether you re stressed about the future. We all worry about our futures at some point. Remember the future isn t set. I could even fail the semester. Then, consider whether you could handle it. Chances are almost always yes. Finally, consider the real likelihood that this will occur. Practice relaxation. Inhale deeply through your nose. Think about something else. Visualize relaxing things, such as a deserted island or a country road. Get away from the cause of the stress. Acknowledge that anxiety is not always bad. Choose your response. You can choose to refocus your thinking. Consider some questions when deciding your approach. Can you avoid it. You can sometimes avoid stressors, thereby changing the situation. Can you alter it. Can you adapt to it. Can you accept it. Some things you simply cannot change. You cannot change or control others feelings, actions, or reactions. Make a plan. Additionally, many stressful situations are avoidable. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Be realistic. Learn from your experience, but let it go. Take one step at a time. Just focus on one small goal at a time. Show yourself patience and kindness as you enact your plans. Stop procrastinating. Often, perfectionism is a culprit. Remind yourself that you cannot control outcomes, only actions. The rest of it is out of your hands. Acknowledge that perfection is an unrealistic standard. Watch out for should statements. Everyone makes mistakes in life. Practice mindfulness. Stress can be a great motivator. Try it for minutes a day. Begin with a handful of raisins. Take one between your fingers and hold it. Turn it around, notice its texture, its ridges and valleys. Make a mental note of what the raisin feels like. Examine the raisin visually. Notice its colors, its shape, its textures. Smell the raisin. Enjoy any aroma that you smell. Try to describe it to yourself. Place the raisin on your tongue. Notice how it feels there. Can you feel the weight. Taste the raisin by taking a small bite. Try to discern what muscles you re using to chew. Swallow the raisin. What muscles are you using. What does it feel like. Try a self compassion break. Think of the stressful situation. Use the RAIN reminder. It stands for Recognize what is going on. For example, I am feeling very angry and stressed right now. Investigate with kindness. She makes me so mad. I made a mistake that I can acknowledge. We can work together to solve this issue. Natural awareness arises from not over personalizing the experience. Begin by finding a quiet place without distractions or interruptions. Avoid having your TV, computer, or cellphone on. Close your eyes and breathe evenly and deeply. Begin by focusing just on your breath. Notice your sensations without judgment. You can also find free audio meditations online. MITand the UCLA Mindful Awareness Research Centerboth have online MP meditations. Repeat positive statements. Here are some examples I can do this. I can do my best. That is all I can do. That is enough. I am bigger than my problems. My mistakes do not define me. I am human. We all make errors. This is temporary and will pass. I can ask for help when I need it. Release stress productively. Try something less harmful, like squeezing a stress ball or doodling. Cry if you want to. Sometimes, you just need to cry. Listen to some soothing music. Take a hot shower or bath\n",

      "Think about the time commitment of ferret proofing your home. Ferrets will chew such objects. Ferrets are social animals. Ferrets do sleep a lot. Remember that ferrets require training. Also, ferrets must be taught proper behavior. Ferrets are intelligent and highly trainable. However, like any animal, training takes time and persistence. Keep cleaning time in mind. You will also need to periodically clean their cage. Remember a ferret s lifespan. Ferrets live between to years. Think about the stability of your living situation. Consider other factors. Avoid a ferret if you have young children. Ferrets do not do well with young children. Ferrets will bite if handled roughly. Ferrets can get along well with older children, however. Think about how busy your home is. First, ferrets are underfoot a lot. Second, ferrets have tendency to escape. Consider your other pets. Ferrets generally do best in a home without other pets. Cats and dogs are often aggressive with ferrets. Ferrets will pray on smaller animals, like mice and rats. Even during play, a dog or cat could accidentally harm a ferret. Decide whether you can tolerate the smell. Ferrets come with a strong odor. The scent glands a ferret uses to mark territory secrete oil, leaving a musty scent in your home. Also, think about legally housing a ferret. Check with your landlord before adopting a ferret. Learn about adoption and purchase fees. Ferrets are not cheap. Make sure you can afford vaccinations. Like all animals, ferrets need basic vaccinations to prevent diseases like rabies. Not all vets are familiar with treating ferrets. Consider the cost of sterilization. Weigh in other general costs of care. You will need extra money for vet bills\n",
